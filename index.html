            <h1>Abhinav's Personal Portfoilio</h1>
            <!--Three different positive character traits-->
            <p style="color: rgb(221, 13, 54), "> Energetic, artistic, determined.</p>
            <h1></h1>
            <p> Little bit about me:
            <h1></h1>
            <p> I am in 9th grade, 15 years old, and I love to do sports and many outside acitvities wiht my friends.
                I play soccer as my main sport which I really enjoy playing and currently on the EHS soccer freshmen
                team.
                I love going outside playing sports even if I'm not good at them.
                I have a faimly of four people, me, my dad, my mom, and my younger sister.
                As of right now I really don't have a plan for my career choice.</p>
            <h1>Career plan/goals</h1>
            <p> I want to get into the field of software engineering or possibly making a buisness. I don't have
                straight plan
                and really don't know what career path I will be willing to pursue.
                I always wanted to be professional soccer player but those goals are not realistically as 1% of people go
                pro which
                is really hard to make.
                So realistically I think I will focus on software engineering as my start up for my career plan at least for now.
                I still
                want to see what else I can do and want to pursue for my career choice as there are many options for me
                to
                choose and to commit.</p>
            <h1>Strengths and Personal Qualities</h1>
            <p> Some strengths I have are communicating with my peers and being very cooperative with them. I am also a
                great
                leader trying to push others as well as myself. Some personal qualties about me are that I am very easy
                to talk
                to and reach out to which makes it easier to relate and be comfortable with my peers.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">

                <h1>Important Achievements</h1>
                <p> There are many important achivements in my life so far that I am very proud of. To begin with, I am
                    finally a
                    black belt after a grueling 6 month process that trained me in the most harsh conditions that were
                    set by my
                    instructors which I have to surpass. I got a first place medal for my soccer club when I was playing
                    at the age
                    of 10.
                    I've won multiple chess trophies when I was huge chess player in elementary.</p>
            <h1>My Abilities and Work Skills </h1>
            <p> I have a lot of experience in working in groups which makes me piece out that I am better off working
                with a
                group of productive people who also push me. I am mostly very approabale and will be glad to help my
                peers out
                with a problem they have.
                I work a lot better in a group environment as it makes me more focus and since I am a very social and
                interactive person and helps me be a better leader and team member.</p>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p> Overall, even though I don't have a straight path that I want to pursue yet, I still have many
                oppurtunities to
                find something I have interest in that I feel most statisfied about. If I do keep these positive
                qualities about
                myself, I can hopefully find a career path that will make me succeed and make me happy in the long run.
                Of course I need to be hard-working and diligent person throughout life in order to succeed and make my
                parents
                proud which is my main goal. I also want to keep playing soccer in the future. For now, I need to push
                through
                highschool, get good grades, go to college and choose a career path that I will be most sucessful at.
